# Socialcademy - SwiftUI and Firebase Project

Submitted by: **Ibrahim Awoleiro**

This Swift app was part of my Swift Path on Codecademy.

## Overview

Welcome to **Build a Social Media iOS App with Firebase and SwiftUI**! In this Skill Path, I learned how to use Swift to make network calls and retrieve information from external APIs. SwiftUI has great tools for getting data online, which I used to build an application that pulls users from the Random User Generator API.

Next, I built out **Socialcademy**, a robust, fully-featured social media application using Firebase. In Socialcademy, users can create accounts, upload posts, and view and comment on posts from other users. I built many other features along the way as well!

By mastering the concepts in this Skill Path, Iâ€™m now ready to build high-quality iOS applications that thousands of people can use. Let's get started!
